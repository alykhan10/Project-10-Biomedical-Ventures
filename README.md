# Project #11: Medical Diagnostics
# Modulating an Electroneurogram for Early Detection of Multiple Sclerosis

● Explored electroneurogram (ENG) as a minimally-invasive method for sensorimotor stimulation of the vagus nerve           
● Designed proof-of-concept with 2 cuff electrodes to measure latency change from action potential across nerves            
● Identified beamforming as a spatial filter to isolate impulses, amplify signal-to-noise ratio and reduce crosstalk
